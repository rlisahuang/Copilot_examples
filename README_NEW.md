### Data Science
1. Send a query to some API to obtain some data
2. Grab the first ten data points from the response, both for the x and the y axes
-- limitations: bad support for large quantities of data
3. Plot the data
4. Notice that the labels on the x axis are too long. 
5. Go back to step 2 to shorten the data neede for the x axis labels.

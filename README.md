# Copilot_examples
Best examples to look at:

1. matplotlib -> understanding imports  
 In the matplotlib folder:
    1. Nadia's_Copilot.py: Real world example of a plot that programmer's may need to generate
      - Copilot helped generate some code
      - Projection Boxes could help quickly show how each line of code affects the plot and help programmers determine if that is what they intended
      - If not, then they can change the code and see how the change affects the plot immediately 
    2. subplot.py: Short example, but based on a question that many programmers have asked on StackOverFlow
      - Used question as prompt for Copilot
      - Projection Boxes can help programmers recognize if code does as they intended
      - Projection Boxes offers a visual explanation as to what each line of code does -> aids in understanding code
    3. barlabels.py: Short example, but based on a question that many programmers have asked on StackOverFlow
      - Used question as prompt for Copilot
      - Projection Boxes can help programmers recognize if code does as they intended
      - In this example, the first few chunks of code written by Copilot did not give the intended results
      
2. re (regular expressions) -> understanding imports  
 In re_import.py file:
     1. def isPhoneNumer(): Example of Copilot helping to write RegExp
       - Copilot's first few attempts did not pass all the test cases
       - Projection Boxes (and PBUnit) would help programmer's quickly recognize if the RegExp that Copilot generate is correct or incorrect
        
3. Data manipulation -> recognizing large blocks of code  
 In the advent folder:
    1. advent14_P19.py: From previous user student, Participant 19 used lots of natural language prompts to get Copilot to write code for them
      - P19 would use print statements to ensure that they and/or Copilot was manipulating the code correctly. Print statements could be replaced by Projection Boxes.
      - In task 2, P19 accepted blocks of code generated by Copilot. They then went back an looked line by line to try to understand what the code was doing.
        Projection Boxes would aid in this process.  
 In the leetcode folder:
    2. substringConcat.py: Manipulating strings
      - First Copilot generated code failed a test case
      - Projection Boxes could help understand the logic of the generated code and help debug, or encourage programmer to try something else
      - Second Copilot generated code passed
        
4. Data structures -> recognizing large blocks of code  
 In the leetcode folder:
    1. reverseKNodes.py: Visualizing linked lists
      - Copilot generated code can be hard to check as there are a lot of pointers to keep track of
      - Visualization of the objects would help programmers understand the code that Copilot wrote and determine if the generated code if correct
    2. mergeKLists: Visualizing linked lists
